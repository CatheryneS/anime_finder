# AnimeFinder

Welcome to your Anime Finder! With this gem you will be able to search animes based on genres. Once you find an anime title you're
interested in, select it to display the summary, other genres it belongs to, and a link to where you can watch it/get more details.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'anime_finder'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install anime_finder

## Usage

Select a genre from an outputed list.
A list of related animes will be listed.
Select an anime to display more details.
Start over with a new genre.
At the end you see all of the Anime you have viewed more details about by typing 'anime'.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
